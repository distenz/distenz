# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

You are quite strange to visit this page. How can I help you?

[dots](https://github.com/distenz/dotfiles)? PROVIDED AS IS, no guarantees etc.
It is for me to run my stuff, not to be useful to you nor to be consumed by 
you.

Anyways...

## things to do
- [ ] move these lists into github projects? I could store the PDE stuff in the
dotfiles repo's project at least.

Might be nice to jump on 
[Advent of Code 23](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)?
I should do it but dec already started, maybe later in 24. I need to do todos 
first. If I want to learn zig or rust or go, that could be good.

- [x] do the todos to do todos from on a later date

### UWU todos. w/e that means. ah. got it. dev from first principles?
- [x] cpu renderer [repo](https://github.com/distenz/renderer)
- [ ] sometyhing trivial that runs through vulkan or opengl
- [ ] project that runs a closed system, probably a mini globe, with some stupid 
gene model powered agents.
- [ ] possible branch off to a game. highly unlikely. possibility for self 
employment
- [ ] something to boot into. bios or preferably UEFI
- [ ] check out [libreboot](https://libreboot.org)?
- [ ] check out how to do the same on ARM
- [ ] check whats up with opensource AMD and intel SoCs or any open source gpu 
drivers?
- [ ] if it makes any sense - probably not - write a driver for some gpu?

### PDE (as in Personalized Development Environment) todos
#### nvim
- [x] fix fugitive `=` on obelisk. ok, so my `=` on the ferris got 
changed or smth. the other keyboard's `=` works just fine, also `fugitive_>` 
works just fine. smh.
- [ ] *fix the `=` char on the ferris*
- [ ] *fix the `Super+Shift+3(layer1+e)` shortcut on the ferris*
- [x] diagnostic text fix. the inline runs off screen. auto popup no good, cuz 
it covers info popup. *I needed to reset the local state and reinstall all*
- [x] fix missing packer. *forgot to require it on init. that is why my auto 
install script did not work as well. _gulp_*
- [ ] auto set line numbers on netrw
- [ ] telescope C fzf
- [ ] fix diagnostic errors since gruvbox/catppuccin udate on obelisk
- [ ] fzf with file constraints eg. extensions. now I have to separately grep
- [ ] fix telescpe preview freeze on long lines. it might not be telescope but 
lsp.
- [ ] uxterm alt-backspace bind
- [ ] can't I run the latency measuring tool on sway now? I fixed the 
screenshare or did the tool not support sway in general?
- [ ] switch from packer. I do not like it that much. mb look at lazy?
- [ ] telescope is a pain in general, I do not like it. need alternative for 
fzf, content grep, buffer list display/nav. alternatively check its man more 
deeply. maybe all my problems are adressable.
    - I cant toggle preview, can only go by 1 file at a time and it freezes 
    some entries. 
    - Deleting in the input should allow ctrl-u. feels bad to edit it vim 
    style because I exit insert mode by Ctrl-c and it closes the popup
    - I want to exit with esc, but it only leaves insert mode and I have to 
    press it twice which is 4 keypress for me god please have mercy on my soul
    sometimes telescope absolutely frustrates me

### DE (as in Desktop Environment) todos 
- [ ] fix `nm` vpn issue at random intervals. DNS over VPN stops being 
reachable?
- [x] fix mic over bluetooth headst on dell. *okey so I learned that bluetooth 
headsets have different audio profiles and I was using mine in `A2DP` mode.
If I want to access the device's sink to use as my mic, I have to switch to 
`HFP`. Now I understand why did my headset's audio quality go down when I 
opened meets. Some interlaying system automatically changed profiles.*
- [ ] check how does other platforms do the auto switch on bluetooth profiles.
- [ ] fix clamshell sway sys binds, broke after the duplicate ubuntu oem drivers
- [ ] fix sway screenshare on dell to work with windows. curr. only screen works
- [ ] fix power profile/fans on obelisk. prob also needs repaste.
- [ ] find low latency foot replacement to wayland 
    - fix nvim cursor issues in MLTeerm is an option too
- [ ] set i3 bar active workspace bg color 
- [ ] check out primeagen's tmux fzf manual thingy? frontend masters dev. prod. 
course.
- [ ] maybe? do some custom bar&widget stuff with `eew` or smth like that. it 
seems not that functional atm. it has to provide value for dev. Do not want to 
run custom DE on monolith, so has to be useful for dell or obelisk
- [ ] maybe do a debian+gnome on monolith? lets wait for feedback on current. it 
is supported for another .5y
- [ ] maybe do an immutable os eg. VanillaOS if monolith bricks.
- [ ] add flatpak to monolith if need arise?
