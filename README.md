# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

You are quite strange to visit this page. 

Anyhoo, [dots](https://github.com/distenz/dotfiles)? Provided as is, no guarantees etc. It is for me to run my stuff, not to be useful to others.

## things to do

- [x] do the todos to do todos from on a later date
- [x] move these lists into github projects

All is done then.
